File Utilities Repository                     July 2016

This repository contains a set of programs and scripts,
particularly useful to manipulate ASCII and HDF5 files.
The repository supports ASCII/HDF5 files containing disconnected
loops, as well as two- and three-point correlation functions.
These ASCII/HDF5 files are expected to be output of the QUDA
library and therefore should have the QUDA libary writing
format.
