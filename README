This repository contains a set of programs and scripts,
particularly useful to manipulate ASCII and HDF5 files.
The repository supports ASCII/HDF5 files containing disconnected
loops, as well as two- and three-point correlation functions.
These ASCII/HDF5 files are expected to be output of the QUDA
library and therefore should have the QUDA libary writing
format. 

- Extract
This folder contains C/C++ programs to extract HDF5 files
into their corresponding ASCII format. The HDF5 library is
required to compile these programs.

- Convert
This folder contains C/C++ programs to convert ASCII files
into the HDF5 format. The HDF5 library is required to compile
these programs.

- scripts_h5
This folder contains scripts which run the programs that extract
HDF5 files. Additional scripts reshape ASCII files into a different,
predefined ASCII form to ensure compatibility.
